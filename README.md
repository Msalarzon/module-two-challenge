# Module Two Challenge: Dynamic Portfolio

## Description

For this project I have carefully developed a dynamic portfolio page to demonstrate my skills and showcase my projects. 
My portfolio aims to serve as a useful tool during my job search, allowing me to realize the benefits of my recent learning in HTML building and structuring, flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.

## Project 
(Key Features)

**Code Organization & Accessibility Improvements:**
- Restructured both HTML and CSS files to adopt a modular approach, promoting a more organized and manageable codebase.
- Ensured the inclusion of temporary generic alt text for all images, laying the groundwork for future customization to better suit specific image content and enhance the experience for users relying on screen readers.
   
**Optimizations:**
- While specific performance optimizations weren't the primary focus of this refactoring, the codebase is now better structured to facilitate future enhancements and optimizations.

(I have completed the challenge to build a comprehensive portfolio, meeting the key features and requirements, including):

**Introduction Section:**
  - The page presents my name, a recent photo or avatar, and navigation links to sections about me, my work, and contact information.

**Navigation:**
  - Clicking on the navigation links scrolls the UI to the corresponding sections.

**Work Section:**
  - The work section features titled images of my applications.
  - Added personalized temporary links to projects, providing a preview of the application's functionality. (Please note that these links currently serve as placeholders and do not redirect to live applications).


**Application Size Differentiation:**
  - Clicking on the images of the applications presents a mockup scenario for future use. Currently, the links do not redirect to live applications but serve as placeholders for showcasing the functionality.

**Responsive Layout:**
  - The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing experience.
